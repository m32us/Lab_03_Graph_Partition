# Lab 02: IMPLEMENT BREADTH FIRST SEARCH (BFS) AND DEPTH FIRST SEARCH (DFS).

In this project, we implement Breadth First Search (BFS) and Depth Frist Search (DFS) based on the given structure of Graph.
	
## Setup
We just install the *datetime* library only for logging status. If you don't have just reinstall by using the below command.

```
pip install datetime
```
## Structure of Library

1.  Vertex class
    
    - The **Vertex** class contains 2 features as below:
     
      - `id`: used to identify the the vertex in Graph.
     
      - `connectedTo`: handling which vertex is connected with this vertex.
    
    - Functions:
     
        - `addNeighbor(self, nbr, weight=0)`: module adding neighbor for Vertex.

        - `__str__(self)`: module for show the information of vertex.

        - `getId(self)`: module getting the `id` of this vertex.

        - `getWeight(self, nbr)`: module getting weight of connection between this vertex and vertex `nbr`.

    
2.  Graph class

    - The **Graph** class is our main class for managing and contains main functions to organise and work with graph data. It has 2 main components including:
      
      - `vertList`: saving all vertices of Graph, each element is a Vertex identified by its `id`.
      
      - `numVertices`: is the number of vertices.

    - Functions:
        
        - `addVertex(self, key)`: module adding a vertex to Graph.
        
        - `getVertex(self, n)`: module returning Vertex `n` of Graph.
        
        - `__contains__(self, n)`: module to determine does vertex `n` belonged to Graph.
        
        - `addEdge(self, f, t, weight=0)`: module adding an Edge to Graph.

        -  `getVertices(self)`: module to get list vertex name of Graph.
        
        - `__iter__(self)`: module for looping with the vertices adjacency of each Vertex in Graph.

        - `BFS(self, vertex_ith: int)`: module applying Breadth First Search Algorithm.
        
        - `DFS(self, vertex_ith: int)`: module applying Depth First Search Algorithm.

3. Support functions:

    - `get_log(message, log_type='INFO')`: module to return log message including the log type and time execute and message.

    - `save_path(path: list, file_name=None, mode='stdout')`: module writing path to screen or to file.
